## Introduction
This work investigates the effects of porosity and grain size on the microstructure evolution and compressive properties of sintered porous polycrystalline Ag for the power electronics and flexible devices. Mechanical responses and microstructural deformations of the specimens with the porosities ranging from 0% to 36.5% and different grain sizes were analyzed under micro-compression tests, experimentally and numerically. The small number of pores and the finer grain size improve the mechanical properties and fracture resistance. It is a critical benchmark for analyzing and modeling the sintered polycrystalline silver in practical applications.
