## Introduction
This work investigates the effects of porosity and grain size on the microstructure evolution and compressive properties of sintered porous polycrystalline Ag for the power electronics and flexible devices. Meso-scale modeling for mechanical responses and microstructural deformations of the specimens with the varied porositiesand grain sizes were analyzed under micro-compression tests and numerically. It provides a critical benchmark for analyzing and modeling the sintered polycrystalline silver in practical applications.<br>
